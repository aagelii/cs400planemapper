Files Written by Me:
--------------------
-Frontend.java: This file takes in the path to a csv file passing it to the backend, then runs
the program. Essentially, this file serves the purpose of being what the user interacts with, from
typing in commands, to visually seeing the airport data on the screen.

-FrontEndDeveloperTests.java: This file is the test file for the Frontend.java file. All it is meant
to do is ensure the correct output is being produced by Frontend.java for given inputs. The tests
include, exiting the program by entering "x", entering search mode with "s" then exiting the program
with "x" inputted twice, lastly, entering insert mode with "i" then exiting the program with "x"
inputted twice.
